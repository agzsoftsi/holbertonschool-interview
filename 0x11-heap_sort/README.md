# Requirements

## General

> - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
> - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
> - Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
> - All your files should end with a new line
> - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
> - Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
> - You are not allowed to use global variables
> - No more than 5 functions per file
> - Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. > - Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
> - In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
> - The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
> - Don’t forget to push your header file
> - All your header files should be include guarded
> - A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.



## Whiteboarding

## More Info

For this project you are given the following print_array function:

```sh
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * print_array - Prints an array of integers
 *
 * @array: The array to be printed
 * @size: Number of elements in @array
 */
void print_array(const int *array, size_t size)
{
    size_t i;

    i = 0;
    while (array && i < size)
    {
        if (i > 0)
            printf(", ");
        printf("%d", array[i]);
        ++i;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

Our file print_array.c will be compiled with your functions during the correction.
Please declare the prototype of the function print_array in your sort.h header file
Please, note this format is used for Task questions.

- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
- …

Please use the “short” notation (don’t use constants). Example: O(nk) or O(wn) should be written O(n). If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have an empty line at the end.

## Task

**0. Heap sort**

File: [0-heap_sort.c](0-heap_sort.c/) - [0-main.py](0-main.py/) - [0-O](0-O/) - [print_array.c](print_array.c/)

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

- Prototype: void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);
- You must implement the sift-down heap sort algorithm
- You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Heap sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case

0-main.py

```sh
alex@/tmp/sort$ cat 0-main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "sort.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */
int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {19, 48, 99, 71, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7};
    size_t n = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    print_array(array, n);
    printf("\n");
    heap_sort(array, n);
    printf("\n");
    print_array(array, n);
    return (0);
}

```
