## Task

**0. Count it!**

File: [0-count.py](0-count.py/) - [0-main.py](0-main.py/)

Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).

### Requirements:

- Prototype: def count_words(subreddit, word_list)
- Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied and a list of keywords. AKA you can add a counter or anything else, but the function must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
- If word_list contains the same word (case-insensitive), the final count should be the sum of each duplicate (example below with java)
- Results should be printed in descending order, by the count, and if the count is the same for separate keywords, they should then be sorted alphabetically (ascending, from A to Z). Words with no matches should be skipped and not printed. Words must be printed in lowercase.
- Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears, not titles it appears in. java java java counts as 3 separate occurrences of java.
- To make life easier, java. or java! or java_ should not count as java
- If no posts match or the subreddit is invalid, print a newline.
- NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are NOT following redirects.

Your code will NOT pass if you are using a loop and not recursively calling the function! This /can/ be done with a loop but the point is to use a recursive function. :)

Disclaimer: number presented in this example cannot be accurate now - Reddit is hot articles are always changing.

0-main.py

import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    count_words = __import__('0-count').count_words
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: {} <subreddit> <list of keywords>".format(sys.argv[0]))
        print("Ex: {} programming 'python java javascript'".format(sys.argv[0]))
    else:
        result = count_words(sys.argv[1], [x for x in sys.argv[2].split()])
"""

Testing

```sh

java: 27
javascript: 20
python: 17
react: 17
scala: 4
bob@dylan $ python3 0-main.py programming 'JavA java'
java: 54
bob@dylan $ python3 0-main.py not_a_valid_subreddit 'python java javascript scala no_results_for_this_one'
bob@dylan $ python3 0-main.py not_a_valid_subreddit 'python java'
