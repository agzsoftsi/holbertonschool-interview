## Task

**0. Change comes from within**

File: [0-making_change.py](0-making_change.py/) - [0-main.py](0-main.py/)

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

- Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
- Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
> - If total is 0 or less, return 0
> - If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
- coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
- The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
- Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task
